# Scaling Study

***Serial vs Shared Memory CPU vs Distributed Memory CPU***

### ðŸ’ª Strong Scaling Study (Fixed Problem Size)

For this strong study, we used  `k = 8`, `tolerance=1e-4`, and used the full dataset. We also set `max_iterations=100`, though this threshold was never reached and has no bearing on the computation time.

| Threads / Ranks | Serial Time (s) | Shared Memory (OpenMP) Time (s) | Distributed Memory (MPI) Time (s) | OpenMP Speedup | MPI Speedup | Shared Memory  Efficiency (%) | Distributed memory Efficiency (%) |
